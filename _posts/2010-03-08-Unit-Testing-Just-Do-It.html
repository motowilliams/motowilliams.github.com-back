<p>I used to be the ConsoleApplication132 type of developer and no big surprise my projects didn't have any unit tests in them, if any at all.&nbsp; To try and remedy this I took a 3 week TestProject1 challenge.&nbsp; Instead of doing quick spikes to a .NET console application to 'try something out' I spun up a Test Project.</p>

<p>So where am I now?&nbsp; Well my stuff has tests, but I'm in some bell curve of using Mocks improperly and over specifying my tests.&nbsp; I really like the naming style of BDD but flirted around with class name test method convention is about as deep as I have got into that realm so far.</p>
<p>... to be continued ... over many years, I'm sure ...</p>
